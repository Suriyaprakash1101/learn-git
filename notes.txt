Git;
git is the open source distributed version control.
it allows the multiple developers to access and manipulate the project simultaneously.
it is the tool to track the changes in the source code during the software development.
it maintains the complete histroy of changes, allows the developers to revert the previous version and compare the changes.

GitHub:
it is the cloud based platform hosting the git repository.
it provide web based interface and enhance feature like collaboration and project management.

Sample add file from local to git repo:
>first we create the new repo. in the github
>we see the code option in the created repo. it contains https link.
>open code editor terminal use command git clone <link> 
>now your repo. is cloned in local machine. It has two folder one is git folder and another one is working folder. we can modify only in working folder.
>create a new file in it after that we see 'U' symbol in that file it means the file is untracking. 
>we change the directory by using cd directoryName.
>git add fileName ->it add the particular file into the staging area. or git add . this command add the entire folder changes into the staging area.
>git commit -m "give message" -> this command commit file into the git folder. This command save the file in working folder but cannot the push into git repo.
>git commit push origin main  -> this command push the file into the git repo. origin is the link we provided in first. and main represent the branch.
now you see the added file in the github repo.

sample get changes from the remote repo.
>git pull origin -> by using this command, local file is modify based on the changes occured remote file.
>git pull origin main -> this command, local file is modify based on the changes occured remote file in a particular branch.

sample: we create the folder and file in local machine we see about how to add this to the remote repo.
>first we create the folder and file in the local machine.
>The folder in the local machine does not contains the git hub folder inside it.
>so we use git init command to initilize the git folder inside the created folder.
>now git folder present in the created folder.
>git add . -> by using this command, we add the group of file inside the created folder into the staging area.
>git commit -m "change committed" ->we commit the file into the github folder in the local machine.
>now we change the origin of the repo. because we create new repo manually in the github and we want to add created folder into it
>git remote origin add <Link>
>now check the branch using git branch command it gives output as master. so we change master branch to the main branch using git branch -M main command. now change branch into main.
now we push the file using git push origin main command and we see the changes in it.


> git branch branch_name  ->new brnach creation
>git branch ->check we are in which branch
>git checkout branch_name  ->swtich to branch_name(another branch)
>git branch -a ->list of branch
